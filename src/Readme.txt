this project deals with MNIST digits data base. it uses Scipy's containers to create linear classifiers 
and to classfity. it contains:
    1) read2Numpy2D - functions that read the database and reduces the data to smaller amount of features,
       in order to test some "weak learning" method as adaboost
    2) Perceptron - a Perceptron class and a multi-digit perceptron
    3) AdaBoost
    
I tried to use the notation from 'Understanding Machine Learning' by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. 
hope you have fun using it"""
